"""A base class for binary trees.

Notes
-----
The module provides some custom types for type checking.
- `KeyType`: the key type for a tree node. The key must be comparable.

- `Paris`: an iterator of Key-Value pairs. Yield by traversal functions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    root: `Optional[Node]`
        The root of the tree. The default is `None`.

    Methods
    -------
    search(key: `KeyType`)
        Search a binary tree based on the given key.

        Delete data by its key from a binary treeW.

    Notes
    -----
    One reason to use abstract base class for all types of binary trees
    is to make sure the type of binary trees is compatable. Therefore, binary
    tree traversal can be performed on any type of binary trees.
