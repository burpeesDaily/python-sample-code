    Methods
    -------
    search(key: `KeyType`)
        Search binary tree for a specific key.

    insert(key: `KeyType`)
        Insert data by its key into a binary tree.

    delete(key: `KeyType`)
        Delete data by its key from a binary treeW.

    Notes
    -----
    One reason to use abstract base class for all types of binary trees
    is to make sure the type of binary trees is compatable. Therefore, binary
    tree traversal can be performed on any type of binary trees.
