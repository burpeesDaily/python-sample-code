Binary Search Tree
==================

Binary search trees (BSTs) are a type of data structure that maintains a sorted order of elements. Each node in a BST has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. The left child's value is less than its parent's value, while the right child's value is greater than its parent's value. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
